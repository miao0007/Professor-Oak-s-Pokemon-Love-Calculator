## Pokemon Love User Story
As a single person and lover of Pokémon: I want to search the compatibility of my name with that of a potential partner. I would then like the potential relationship rated in relation to a Pokémon I know. I would also like to know some of the most and least compatible names. This is so I can have fun investigating my compatibility with different people, and have a laugh at the same time.


## Getting Started 
Type your first and last name into the first box, then your potential romantic match's into the second box, then click the search button! Your compatability Pokemon will appear below. You can also click to see the highest and lowest compatibility scores achieved on the app.
